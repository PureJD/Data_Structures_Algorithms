# Data Structures and Algorithms

![Ai Image](https://github.com/PureJD/Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/ReadmeImage.png?raw=true)

#### This is a selection of data structure and algorithm work. The intent behind this repository is to keep a clearly notated and ordered record of all work into different data structures and algorithms. This repository can be revisited and the code can be reused as it has been written to be as efficient as possible. This repository will be updated as I find interesting coding problem solutions and real world problems are overcome.  
#### - Linked Lists
- Work has been completed in linked lists, which includes the creation of a linked list class object. 
- Following the creation of the object many known methods have been recreated in the same file to provide a full and concise 'cheat sheet' for future work using linked lists.
- Linked list creation, reverse, loop through, pop, pop first, append, prepend and find middles methods currently created.
#### - Doubly Linked Lists
- Work has been completed in Doubly linked lists, which includes the creation of a linked list class object with a next value and a previous value per node, allowing more optimised functionality. 
- As above, this repository will be updated as I encounter new and interestig examples and methods of linked lists in real world problems and coding problems.
#### - Stacks and Queues
- An object has been created to show representations of both stacks and queues.
- Both stack and queue contain functions which would be used with their data types. The functions are created with efficiency in mind, meaning the nodes have been taken and added from the optimal side to ensure O(1) over O(n) where possible. 
#### - Binary Search Tree
- This method of search uses divide and conquer and nodes in order to search large quantities of data faster.
#### - Hashtable
